Description
===========

This module provides three things.  

1) The puppet package plugin that adds the *package* subcommand to the *puppet* command.

2) The custom MCollective package agent patched to support the package Face

Face
----

Installation: 
  Make sure this module is in your modulepath and make sure you have pluginsync = true 
  in your puppet config. After a single puppet agent run, the plugin will be synced to the client.

The puppet package face allows you to query what packages have updates available on your system. Updates are
queried from any available provider that supports the *versionable*  and *upgradeable* features. 
See http://docs.puppetlabs.com/references/stable/type.html#package for a list of providers and what 
features they support.

Help: 
  You can get the available subcommands and parameters by using the command *puppet help package*

Example:
  To get a list of all packages that have updates, use the list action
  # puppet package updates

  To update a single package, use the update action.  You can specify which version and the provider to use
  # puppet package update --provider=gem stomp

MCollective
-----------

Installation:
  Copy the ext/mcollective/agents/package.ddl and ext/mcollective/agents/package.rb files to your configured libdir
  in MCollective (usually /usr/libexec/mcollective/mcollective/agents).  Reload the agents with this command:
  # mc-controller reload_agents

To apply a series of updates, you can use a hash in the form 
{ package_name => { :update => update_version, :provider => package_provider } }
Pass the hash to the update action

Help:
  To see what the available commands are and what the expect/return, use the mco help utility
  # mco help package
